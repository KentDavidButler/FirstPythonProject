First python project. Going back over old Grand Circus projects in Python.

Given an integer, N, perform the following conditional actions:

If N is odd, print Weird
If N is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print Not Weird
If N is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print Weird
If N is even and greater than 20, print Not Weird
